# HTML5 Practical (No CSS, No JS)

This project demonstrates semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility features, and media embedding.  
It was built as a practical exercise in pure HTML5 (no CSS or JavaScript).

## Pages
- **index.html** — Semantic layout, skip link, headings, quotes, micro-elements.
- **about.html** — Sections, unordered/ordered/definition lists.
- **media.html** — Responsive images, audio, and video with captions.
- **extras.html** — Tables, `<details>`, `<dialog>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`.
